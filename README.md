## Installation

Before you begin, you will need two things:
1.  **GNOME Tweaks:** To apply the theme.
2.  **User Themes Extension:** To allow GNOME Tweaks to change the shell theme.

You can typically install Tweaks with:
```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
sudo apt install gnome-tweaks

# For Fedora-based systems
sudo dnf install gnome-tweaks
````

You must then [install and enable the **User Themes** extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/) from the GNOME Extensions website.
